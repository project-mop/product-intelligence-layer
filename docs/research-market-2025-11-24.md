|------|---------------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 3 intelligences, 100 API calls/mo | N/A | Evaluation, small projects |
| **Starter** | $99 | 10 intelligences, 1,000 API calls/mo | $0.05/call | Small ecommerce |
| **Growth** | $299 | 25 intelligences, 5,000 API calls/mo | $0.03/call | Growing ecommerce |
| **Professional** | $699 | 100 intelligences, 25,000 API calls/mo | $0.02/call | Mid-market |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Unlimited intelligences, volume pricing | Custom | Large organizations |

**Pricing Rationale:**
- Free tier enables product-led growth (expect 3-5% conversion)
- Starter at $99/mo is below psychological barrier, captures small teams
- Growth/Professional targets mid-market ACV sweet spot ($3.6K-$8.4K)
- Usage overage aligns cost with value delivered
- Enterprise captures larger deals ($15K-$50K+)

**Comparison to Market:**
- Below Salsify/Akeneo ($25K-$60K+) - accessible to mid-market
- Above Hypotenuse ($150/mo starting) - positioned as platform, not tool
- Aligned with API pricing norms (Twilio, Stripe model)

**Expected Metrics:**
- Freemium conversion: 3-5% (industry benchmark for self-serve)
- ACV: $5,000-$8,000 (mid-market segment)
- LTV:CAC target: 3:1 or better

## 9. Risk Assessment

### Risk Analysis

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Score | Category |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|----------|
| Fast followers copy positioning | High | High | **Critical** | Competitive |
| Enterprise incumbents add similar features | High | Medium | **High** | Competitive |
| LLM cost increases | Medium | Low | **Medium** | Supplier |
| Slow enterprise sales cycles | Medium | High | **High** | Execution |
| Data quality issues in customer data | Medium | High | **High** | Execution |
| Market timing (AI fatigue from failed pilots) | Medium | Medium | **Medium** | Market |
| Regulatory changes (AI governance) | Low | Medium | **Low** | Regulatory |

### Mitigation Strategies

#### Critical: Fast Followers

**Risk:** Low barriers to entry mean competitors can replicate quickly

**Mitigation:**
1. **Speed:** Move fast to establish brand and customer relationships
2. **Templates:** Build proprietary industry-specific intelligence templates
3. **Data moat:** Aggregate anonymized patterns to improve outputs
4. **Integrations:** Deep integrations create switching costs
5. **Community:** Build user community around best practices

#### High: Enterprise Incumbents

**Risk:** Salsify, Akeneo, or Zoovu add API-first intelligence features

**Mitigation:**
1. **Price positioning:** Stay 5-10x cheaper
2. **Simplicity:** Maintain no-code, fast time-to-value advantage
3. **Focus:** Go deeper on mid-market needs vs. enterprise complexity
4. **Partnerships:** Partner with incumbents rather than compete directly

#### High: Slow Sales Cycles

**Risk:** Manufacturing and enterprise sales take 6+ months

**Mitigation:**
1. **PLG first:** Build revenue base with self-serve ecommerce
2. **Land and expand:** Start small, grow within accounts
3. **POC process:** Standardized 30-day proof-of-concept
4. **ROI tools:** Calculator showing labor savings

#### High: Data Quality Issues

**Risk:** Customer product data is messy, leading to poor outputs

**Mitigation:**
1. **Data validation:** Input validation before processing
2. **Normalization:** Basic data cleaning as part of ingestion
3. **Feedback loops:** Allow users to rate and correct outputs
4. **Templates:** Pre-built schemas reduce garbage-in-garbage-out
